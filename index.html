        <p style="text-align: justify"> <br> &emsp; Software engineering has long studied how software developers work,
          building a
          body of work which forms the
          foundation of many software engineering best practices, tools, and theories. Recently, some developers have
          begun recording videos of themselves engaged in programming tasks contributing to open source projects,
          enabling them to share knowledge and socialize with other developers. We believe that these videos offer an
          important opportunity for both software engineering research and education. In this paper, we discuss the
          potential use of these videos as well as open questions for how to best enable this envisioned use. We propose
          creating a central repository of programming videos, enabling analyzing and annotating videos to illustrate
          specific behaviors of interest such as asking and answering questions, employing strategies, and software
          engineering theories. Such a repository would offer an important new way in which both software engineering
          researchers and students can understand how software developers work.</p>

          In live-streamed programming, developers broadcast their development work on open source projects using
          streaming media such as YouTube or Twitch. Sessions are first
          announced by a developer acting as the streamer, inviting other
          developers to join and interact as watchers using chat. To
          better understand the characteristics, motivations, and challenges in live-streamed programming, we analyzed
          20 hours of
          live-streamed programming videos and surveyed 7 streamers
          about their experiences. The results reveal that live-streamed
          programming shares some of the characteristics and benefits of
          pair programming, but differs in the nature of the relationship
          between the streamer and watchers. We also found that streamers
          are motivated by knowledge sharing, socializing, and building
          an online identity, but face challenges with tool limitations
          and maintaining engagement with watchers. We discuss the
          implications of these findings, identify limitations with current
          tools, and propose design recommendations for new forms of
          tools to better supporting live-streamed programming.

          As developers debug, developers formulate hypotheses about the cause of the defect and gather evidence to test these hypotheses.
          To better understand the role of hypotheses in debugging, we conducted two studies.
          In a preliminary study, we found that, even with the benefit of modern internet resources, incorrect hypotheses can cause developers
           to investigate irrelevant information and block progress. We then conducted a controlled experiment where 20 developers debugged and
            recorded their hypotheses. We found that developers have few hypotheses, two per defect. Having a correct hypothesis early 
            strongly predicted later success. We also studied the impact of two debugging aids: fault locations and potential hypotheses.
             Offering fault locations did not help developers formulate more correct hypotheses or debug more successfully. In contrast, offering potential hypotheses made developers six times more likely to succeed. 
             These results demonstrate the potential of future debugging tools that enable finding and sharing relevant hypotheses.

          As developers program and debug, they continuously edit and run their code, a behavior known as edit-run cycles. While techniques such as live programming are intended to support this behavior, little is known about the characteristics of edit-run cycles themselves. To bridge this gap, we analyzed 28 hours of programming and debugging work from 11 professional developers which encompassed over three thousand development activities. We mapped activities to edit or run steps, constructing 581 debugging and 207 programming edit-run cycles. We found that edit-run cycles are frequent. Developers edit and run the program, on average, 7 times before fixing a defect and twice before introducing a defect. Developers waited longer before again running the program when programming than debugging, with a mean cycle length of 3 minutes for programming and 1 minute for debugging. Most cycles involved an edit to a single file after which a developer ran the program to observe the impact on the final output. Edit-run cycles which included activities beyond edit and run, such as navigating between files, consulting resources, or interacting with other IDE features, were much longer, with a mean length of 5 minutes, rather than 1.5 minutes. We conclude with a discussion of design recommendations for tools to enable more fluidity in edit-run cycles.
